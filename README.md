### Project Briefing:
This is a Visual Basic script that implements Windows text-to-speech feature. When executed it prompts the user to enter a text and after that it converts the text into speech. Then it again prompts the user to either enter 1 to re-run the script or 0 to terminate the session.
### Additional Notes:
- Visual Basic script generally runs only on Windows.
- Run the program with .exe file to prevent possible glitches.
